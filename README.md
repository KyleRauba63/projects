Hi, thanks for checking out my Data Analysis portfolio!

For the best experience interacting with a viz, please access it through my Tableau Public profile at https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kyle.rauba.

The story below was created using Tableau's publicly available Superstore Sales data, found here (https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/resources?qt-overview_resources=1#qt-overview_resources).
